Below is a query to pull a patient master table from LAAD data for a dashboard project for cardio renal domain. 
We want to change the plan and want to revise the master table layout, rather than make it a patient level data, we want to keep the data to claim level, for each claim, we will have the DX code, so we can find out the DX flags like what we did in the existing query, and we can find the correspoinding rendering HCPS and their specialties. In this new layout case, we can invovle analysis of HCPs.
Due to the data volume concern, we limit the new master table to only the paitient cohort in the CIA_CARDIORENALDASHBOARD_DE_COHORT_ICD10 scope as we did in the previous query.
As I mentioned, for HCPs related field, we will include 'NNI_RENDERING_PR_SPEC_GROUP' for the group and  'NNI_RENDERING_PR_SPEC_NAME' for the individual specality, NNI_RENDERING_CUSTOMER_ID is the id of HCPS, 'zip' as their zip_code and 'state' as their statelevel location.
We are going to remove the filter of 'time_period', but we will leverage the 'service_date' of each claim, so we can create the similar filter on tableau side easily(rather than built it into the master table). for each row, we still maintain all the patients' characteristics, the patients information as the way joined in below query. We want to keep making the patient's DX flag based on each claim's diagnosis code(as we are on claim level)
We want to aggregate and generate a field, which I consider is the tricky part of this new query. For each row, we want to have a "total Dx grouping flag" associate with the patient, to locate the qualified dx flags via patient's all time history in the table. And qualified Dx will be seperated by commas so we can parse them out on tableau. example field value, for a patient ever diagnosed ASCVD, CKD, CKD34, MI. The field value is "ASCVD, CKD, CKD34, MI"

Please consider the computational efficiency when design the query, make clear notes to the code so we can understand. I think most of the logic can be learnt from the below query, especially the relationship between DX and ICD10 code list.
